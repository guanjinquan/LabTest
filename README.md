# LabTest
Classification Task on Pathology Images
<<<<<<< HEAD


## Preprocess Pathology Images 
In `LabTest/Misc/preprocess_data.py`, you should change the `input_dir` to downloaded data folder. 

After that, run the script to preprocess the data. 

```bash
python preprocess_data.py
```


## Train Model
Run the training script to train the model.  e.g.

```bash
bash ./Scripts/train_vit_small_pathology.sh
```

Then, you can monitor the training process in `./Results/<model>/<runs_id>/results.png` and `./Results/<model>/<runs_id>/log.txt`.
